# D-Scanner
Dscanner is a tiny program that provides a way for user to d-scan in the fastest way possible.

## How to use
Keybindings:

* `=`, Increases the search range
* `-`, Decreases the search range
* `+`, Undoes the last `=`/`-` input.
* `++`, Reset to the beginning.

## Implementation
The program theory is a simple binary search on the search space of integers in [0-1430],
minor deviations are disregarded.
